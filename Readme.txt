This is how I am recording my progress in learning code. 

May 19, 2017 - I followed my first tutorial in order to successfully set up my own coding environment complete with Node.js, React JS, Babel & Webpack

Now I should be able to use JSX in my Web App.

Tools used: Terminal & Sublime (Text Editor) 

Tutorial found here: https://www.kirupa.com/react/setting_up_react_environment.htm

May 20, 2017 - I have attempted to get myself re-familiarised with GitHubâ€¦ I just pushed my tutorial files from yesterday. I will be doing various React JS - focused tutorials on my own but this repository is going to become my personal test Web App where I can apply the various things that I have been learning.
